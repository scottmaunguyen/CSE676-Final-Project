# CSE676-Final-Project
ModelNet10 Classification with PoinNet Architecture:
In order to run this code, run in Google Collab and run all blocks. There is an optional section in which the model can be saved in your google drive. This was helpful during the training phase, since we wanted to save models for testing. The STL dataset can be provided if requested, but it has not been openly provided to avoid copyright infringement. This dataset was just to test the generalization abilities of our trained model.
