# CSE676-Final-Project
ModelNet10 Classification with PoinNet Architecture:
In order to run this code, run in Google Collab and run all blocks. There is an optional section in which the model can be saved in your google drive. This was helpful during the training phase, since we wanted to save models for testing. The STL dataset can be found in the UBLearns submission. We included it on UBLearns only to avoid copyright infringement.
